# Musical-Instrument-Tuner using MatLab
**Goal:** 
- design and implement a real-time stringed instrument tuner using MATLAB
  
**Concepts Used:** 
- live audio capture via microphone
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- frequency spectrum analysis
  
**Functionality:**
- tuner identifies the fundamental frequency of the played note and maps it to its corresponding musical note and octave. A stable note detection mechanism ensures consistent and reliable feedback for the user, while real-time spectrum visualization provides an intuitive view of the signal
  
**External Packages:**
- MatLab Audio Toolbox (for real-time spectrum visualization plot)
